# React basic

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [React quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=react) to build and customize a new static site.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

npm install ajv

npm cache clean --force
npm install

npm run build

npm install -g serve
serve -s build

npm start

npm start http://localhost:3000

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

  npm install axios
npm install dotenv
npm run build:staging     # Para homologação
npm run build             # Para produção
